Stage 9 of Explorer rocketseat, a challenge to create a Project with the learning from the course.

#  Animated login form

<img src="./form.png"> 


## Project:
-  Make the login form appear when the page opens,
-  Making the fields appear from left to right, making them enter at different times,
-  When you click Login, make the form exit the screen by going down,
-  Remove form from html and don't show scrolling while the form is exiting the screen,
-  Add a different timing effect for the form output,
-  Make the form (vibrate) if there are empty fields,
-  Create some animated squares (that rotate) that go from the bottom of the screen (out of the field of view) to the top of the screen (out of the field of view as well). Details: It should have different sizes, come out at different times, have different timing, continuous animation.
